          <p>Before Code 101, I personally had no experience in coding at all, didn't know the name of HTML, CSS, Javascript, anything at all. On top of that, didn't know the difference between any of those either. Since that start, I also took the 102 class, took Kahn Academy courses, and have now almost finished the Code 201 class. My goal for after the 401 class is to become a junior developer for a local business or just a business that has places here. My end goal is to be able to make projects on my own and little apps or inventions that make life easier and better in small, simple ways. I do think these classes have been pushing me towards getting to that point of self creation. I'm not sure how far the other classes will go with making things flow better, but I'm excited to see what it all becomes.</p>

          <p>Currently, I am a STEM teacher at Mid-Prairie Middle School in Kalona, Iowa.  I have been teaching Design & Modeling as well as Automation & Robotics for the past five years.  However, last year I participated in professional development for code.orgs Computer Science Discoveries curriculum through Newbo Co and implemented the curriculum into my 6th grade class. Prior to Delta V 201, my knowledge and understanding of software development was limited and therefore, I joined this program to further my knowledge and develop my coding skills.  My goal is help the Mid-Prairie School District build our computer science program and provide additional learning opportunities for our students to help them be better prepared and equipped for their future.</p>

          <p>Before I attended DeltaV I had some experience in C# back from when I was first starting to dabble in code when I was 13 or 14 and beginning to experiment with game mods and development. In my early twenties I started playing around with HTML and CSS to get more familiarized with web-design. My goal with DeltaV first and foremost was to expand my knowledge in coding and hone my skillset. After I graduate, professionally, I would like to pursue a career in web/software-development. Personally, I would like to get back into home-brewing classic feeling RPG’s with a more in-depth working knowledge. I feel that DeltaV is the best option to pursue what I’m interested in as there are very intelligent like-minded individuals who are working towards similar goals. The small and personal class also allows us to get to know each other pretty well which is great for making lasting connections.</p>

          <p>My experience with coding starts freshman year of college. I went into college and chose CS as a major and started to learn C++. But quickly found the teaching to be unsatisfactory. I changed my major my second year. I didn't touch code again until I started looking into web design as well as Python. So I taught myself how to design websites and use Python and loved it. But since this was more of a hobby at the time it fizzled out due to life events taking precedence. I then picked it back up again in order to make the leap to freelancing doing web and graphic design. So I brushed up on my HTML and CSS and got to work.  With my newly obtained JS skills I will be pairing this with my prior skills with HTML and CSS to increase the value I can provide to clients as well as increase the amount of work I can offer. I will also be diving into personal projects that I could previously not do since I had no JS skills.  I feel confident that I will be able to achieve all of the goals I have set and get to a point where I can work remotely as I travel the world and pursue all my passions</p>
